# dbson

## Intro

`dbson` is a fast and scalable JSON library written in C, yet published as a Python extension as well. It offers not only JSON serialization
hundreds of times faster than python implementations, but offers many more services, like search,
aggregation, compression, indexing, and analytics. `dbson` attempts to utilize `JSON` and it's core 
structure as a data analysis and big data medium.
